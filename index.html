            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                I relocated from the mid-west to Colorado in the 1980's. My first Colorado apartment was in Castle Rock,
                and from there I slowly worked my way north, living in Littleton, Denver and finally Thornton, which is
                where I currently reside.<br>

                The Colorado sunshine and mild winters have kept me here, though sometimes I did think it would be nice
                to be closer to my family.
                I do travel to Northern Illinois a few times a year to visit them. While there, I assist with my moms
                elder care and actually enjoy the break from Denver traffic.<br>

                The pandemic has changed everyday life for mmost people. I decided this was the perfect opportunity to
                acquire a new skillset and make a career path change. Since I find technology interesting, that seems
                like a logical path for me. Web pages are here to stay (for the foreseeable future), so this is the path
                I've chosen to begin my technology education.
