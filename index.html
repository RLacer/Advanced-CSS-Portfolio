            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                I relocated from the mid-west to Colorado in the 1980's. My first Colorado apartment was in Castle Rock, and from there I slowly worked my way north, living in Littleton, Denver and finally Thornton, which is where I currently reside.<br>

                The Colorado sunshine and mild winters have kept me here, though sometimes I did think it would be nice to be closer to my family.
                I do travel to Northern Illinois a few times a year to visit them. While there, I assist with my moms elder care and actually enjoy the break from Denver traffic.<br>

                The pandemic has changed everyday life for mmost people. I decided this was the perfect opportunity to acquire a new skillset and make a career path change. Since I find technology interesting, that seems like a logical path for me. Web pages are here to stay (for the foreseeable future), so this is the path I've chosen to begin my technology education.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
