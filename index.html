                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <h4>My Brand Statement will be incorporated here.</h4>
                <p>
                    I relocated from the mid-west to Colorado in the 1980's. My first Colorado apartment was in Castle
                    Rock,
                    and from there I slowly worked my way north, living in Littleton, Denver and finally Thornton, which
                    is
                    where I currently reside.<br>

                    The Colorado sunshine and mild winters have kept me here, though sometimes I did think it would be
                    nice
                    to be closer to my family.
                    I do travel to Northern Illinois a few times a year to visit them. While there, I assist with my
                    moms
                    elder care and actually enjoy the break from Denver traffic.<br>

                    The pandemic has changed everyday life for mmost people. I decided this was the perfect opportunity
                    to
                    acquire a new skillset and make a career path change, to something that intrigues me to know more.
